Answer here\n","* 3.1 I would recommend unsupervised machine learning algorithm (e.g., anomaly detection\n","      algorithm), because there is no prior knowledge of specific anomaly on the sensor data, therefore, the machine learning model will have to learn patterns in the data on its own. Unsupervised learning fit into the appropriate machine learning algorithm to be deployed for this type of real-world problem.\n","\n","* 3.2 Supervised machine learning algorithm would be recommended for this problem, because the\n","      prediction is based on historical transaction data and demographics. Meaning the transaction data and the demographics are inputs based on which customer lifetime values can be predicted as the output. This fits into the definintion of supervised learning which predicts an output given an input by learning from pairs of input and outputs (i.e., the machine learning algorithm learns from examples that have had the right answers assigned to them beforehand). Regression analysis is commonly used to predict customer lifetime value based on past transaction data and customer demographics. The objective of the analysis is to forecast a continuous value that reflects the projected future value of a customer.\n","\n","* 3.3 Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithm is recommended for this problemm, because there are\n","      no labels for the machine learning algorithm to learn from. The best approach is you use a machine learning model that will learn and discover patterns in the data in order to segment customer demographics based on their purchase history, browsing behaviour, and preferences. The scenario explained above fit the description of unsupervised learning.\n","\n","* 3.4 Analysing social media posts to categorise them into different themes, the approach to\n","      recommend depends on whether we have access to a sizable, well-labelled dataset of social media posts covering a wide range of themes, and the goal is to accurately classify posts into predefined themes, then a classification supervised learning approach would be appropriate. However, clustering an unsupervised learning strategy may be more appropriate if the labelled data is sparse and unavailable, or if our goal is to investigate emerging themes or patterns in an exploratory way. A semi-supervised approach could also be used in a situation where some of the data is labelled but we want to explore unlabelled data.\n","\n","      \n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"bqsun96o64xe"},"source":["4.\n","For each of the following real-world problems, determine whether it is appropriate to utilise semi-supervised machine learning algorithms.

When the\n","      bulk of emails in a dataset are labelled for spam detection, semi-supervised learning approaches may not be required.
